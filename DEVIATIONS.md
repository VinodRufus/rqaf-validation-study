# Deviations log

Any change made after the prereg tag (prereg-rqaf-v1) or the gold tag (gold-rqaf-v1) is
recorded here with date, reason, and impact, and is reported in the paper. An empty log after
the run is the goal.

## 2026-09-27 Repository-wide study rename (non-substantive)
Letter slugs replaced by descriptive slugs before any model runs:
A->rqaf, B->peds_abstraction, delay->surgical_delay, dosing->peds_dosing,
rag->ehr_rag, phi->phi_leakage, ctx->long_context. Prompt files, config
filenames, data folders and internal paths renamed to match; flagship
record-id prefix changed from B- to REC- and the corpus regenerated from
the same seed (content identical, ids renamed). No design value in any
prereg config changed. Tags prereg-B-v1 and prereg-A-v1 were re-issued as
prereg-peds_abstraction-v1 and prereg-rqaf-v1 on the rename commit.
Zero API runs and zero gold review existed at the time of the rename.
